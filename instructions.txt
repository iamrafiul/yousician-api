Hello;

I have done the test given by you(sician).



To run the project follow the following steps(I am assuming you already have 'pip' installed in your machine.):

1. I have done the project using virtual environment. To install and setup the virtual environment, do the following:

	a. Install virtualenv using pip
	>> pip install virtualenv

	b. Create and activate virtual enviroment in the project directory
	>> virtualenv <env_name>
	>> source <env_name>/bin/activate

This will activate the virtualenv for the project. You can also run the app in your machine without virtualenv but it's more flexible to use virtualenv. 

 2. Install the requirements from requirements.txt using the command:

>> pip install -r requirements.txt

This is will install all the required packages for this app.

3. If you are here now, you are done with the setup and ready to run the app. To run the app, do the following

>> export FLASK_APP=app.py
>> flask run

DONE!! Now the app is runniing at 127.0.0.1:5000. To test the app, as it is an API with no view(Template), I have used a chrome extension called 'Postman'.


To test the app, I have written test.py, you can test this using

>> python test.py

from the command line.
